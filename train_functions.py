    """
    Converts both a protein file (PDB or mol2) and its ligand (if specified)
    to a grid.

    To make a 16x16x16x18 grid, max_dist should be 7.5 and grid_resolution = 1
    because make_grid returns np.ndarray, shape = (M, M, M, F) and 
    M is equal to (2 * `max_dist` / `grid_resolution`) + 1  
    36x36x36x18 --> max_dist = 35 and grid_resolution = 2
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    file_type: "pdb", "mol2"
    prot_input_file, ligand_input_file: protein and ligand files
    grid_resolution: float, optional
        Resolution of a grid (in Angstroms).
    max_dist: float, optional
        Maximum distance between atom and box center. Resulting box has size of
        2*`max_dist`+1 Angstroms and atoms that are too far away are not
        included.
